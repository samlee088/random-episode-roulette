# random episode roulette

## Description

This is a project was created with Nextjs, Firebase, Authjs, Zustand, and deployed with Vercel. The application was inspired by the moments when I wanted to watch a random episode of a tv show, but I wanted the episode to be from a particular set of seasons. This lead me to create random episode roulette.
