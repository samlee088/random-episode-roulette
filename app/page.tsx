          Hello, Welcome to Episode Roulette

          This website was inspired by my need to find a random episode in my
          favorite tv shows. I found myself wanting to watch a random episode,
          only from a couple of selection seasons, depending on my mood. Instead
          of having to go to a generic random episode generator and waiting
          until something that I was looking for came up, I was able for someone
          to make a decision that I agreed with!
